![Scheduler Overview](Scheduler.png)

This folder schedules the neural-rendering operator graph defined in `Operator` onto the hardware modules specified in `Hardware`, and calculates the resulting latency.

## Schedule

Here, we provide a Python implementation of GSCore scheduling. The file assumes that the operator graph and hardware results have already been produced in earlier stages (the software workflow and hardware platform, respectively) and offers examples of both scheduling and design-space exploration.

```bash
python gscore_schedule.py
```
